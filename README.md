# Portfolio

This is a list of work that I have compiled since I began coding in late 2017. It is split into three components:

Projects: Substantial pieces of code that exhibit a variety of skills
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
LeetCode: Submissions to LeetCode problems
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Other Work: Code that is neither a LeetCode submission nor part of a project
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
